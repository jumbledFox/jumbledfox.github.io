<h2><em>GAMES</em></h2>
<p>I've made a few games in my time, some more than others.. Here they are in all their glory.</p>
<p><a href="/games/swag-weaselz">Swag Weaselz</a> - Made in around a day, this simple scratch game about shooting blocky green enemies is weasel-tastic. Now featuring some epic doom-style box art I drew!</p>
<p><a href="/games/trash-and-lasers">Trash and Lasers</a> -  A game about destroying trash in the ocean with lasers! Made for the Polymars <a href="https://itch.io/jam/seajam">SEAJAM</a>.</p>

<p>From gizmos to gadgets, I like to tinker. Here are some physical things I've made, more to come in the future.</p>
<p><a href="/projects/the-internet">The Internet</a> - My homemade prop of The Internet from The IT Crowd.</p>
<p><a href="/projects/led-flashing-light-mask">LED Flashing Light Mask</a> - An eye mask that flashes red light at a user-defined speed and brightness. Made for my mum</p>

<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<p>Hello!!! You can call me jumbledFox. I program in Rust, Python, and C++, as well as the occasional website overhaul.</p>
<p>I'm only recently learning Rust after a good few years of C++, getting used to it is going to take some time!</p>
<p>I love a bunch of different kinds of music, mainly prog rock though. My favourite bands are Pink Floyd, Genesis, Supertramp, The Police, Oingo Boingo, ELO, The Beatles, Huey Lewis, Yes, Rush, The Alan Parsons Project, Men Without Hats, Kraftwerk, Iron Maiden, and Van Halen.. which is a very long list haha</p>
<p>I love Half-Life, CS:GO, and Portal, they're some of my favourite games and huge inspirations in my projects :3</p>
<p>My discord is <r>jumbledFox#7214</r>, feel free to add me!</p>

<h1>ABOUT THIS WEBSITE</h1>
<p>This website was generated with my static website generator <a href="https://github.com/jumbledFox/Sting">Sting</a>, named after Sting of 'The Police' fame.</p>
<p>I designed it myself, it uses the css mix-blend-mode multiply to make anything the background image, which I think looks really nice!!</p>
